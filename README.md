# About me
👋 Hi there! I'm Amy, a backend Go engineer 

I'm passionate about crafting robust, scalable solutions, I thrive on transforming intricate challenges into elegant solutions.In a world of 1s and 0s, I believe in the elegance of simplicity and the power of clean, maintainable code. 
Whether it's optimizing algorithms or sculpting databases, I strive for efficiency without compromising clarity.

🚀 Currently, I'm an experienced freelance Golang engineer, crafting custom solutions that drive business success. My projects range from building bespoke CRM systems tailored to clients' unique needs to developing sophisticated analytical software for decision-making.

💼 Seeking a full-time permanent role to bring my expertise in Go development to a dynamic team and contribute to impactful projects on a larger scale.

🛠️ Tech I Love: Leveraging concurrency in Go, harnessing goroutines, working with Gorilla Mux for routing, diving into databases with MySQL and PostgreSQL, crafting command-line interfaces with Cobra, and wielding tools like bufio and strconv for efficient data processing

👽 Outside of programming, I enjoy classic sci-fi and playing modern as well as retro video games.

🔗 My GitHub serves as a curated showcase of projects, from large-scale examples to microservices and smaller, demonstrative projects highlighting specific skills and the versatility of Golang.

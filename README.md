üöÄ Currently, I'm an experienced freelance Golang engineer, crafting custom solutions that drive business success. My projects range from building bespoke CRM systems tailored to clients' unique needs to developing sophisticated analytical software for decision-making.

üíº Seeking a full-time permanent role to bring my expertise in Go development to a dynamic team and contribute to impactful projects on a larger scale.

üëΩ Outside of programming, I enjoy classic sci-fi and playing both modern and retro video games.

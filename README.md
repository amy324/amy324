# About me
üëã Hi there! I'm Amy, a backend Go engineer 

üõ†Ô∏è Tech/Techniques I Love:

**Concurrency**, **goroutines**, **mutexes**, **pointers**, **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **os/exec**, **Docker/Kubernettes containerization**, **Cobra**, **JWT** dependency management with **Go Modules**, **RESTful API** development using **Gin** or **Gorilla/Mux** framework, logging with **logrus**, monitoring with **Prometheus**, performance optimization through **profiling, caching, and code refactoring**, continuous integration/continuous deployment **(CI/CD)** setup using **Jenkins**, **WebSockets** for implementing real-time communication, **microservices** architecture design and development using **gRPC**, **GraphQL** API development with **gqlgen**, **integration of Python** scripts into Golang applications,  writing comprehensive tests including **unit, integration, and end-to-end tests** using **testing and testify frameworks**, **encryption and authentication** for data security, **AWS (Lambda, ECS, EC2)** for efficient deployment, **middleware implementation** for request processing, error handling using Go's built-in **error handling** mechanisms and custom error types, and context handling for managing context cancellation, timeouts, and deadlines in concurrent programs.

üöÄ Currently, I'm an experienced freelance Golang engineer, crafting custom solutions that drive business success. My projects range from building bespoke CRM systems tailored to clients' unique needs to developing sophisticated analytical software for decision-making.

üíº Seeking a full-time permanent role to bring my expertise in Go development to a dynamic team and contribute to impactful projects on a larger scale.

üëΩ Outside of programming, I enjoy classic sci-fi and playing both modern and retro video games.

üîó My GitHub serves as a curated showcase of projects, from large-scale examples to microservices and smaller, demonstrative projects highlighting specific skills and the versatility of Golang.

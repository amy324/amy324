# About me
👋 Hi there! I'm Amy, a backend Go engineer 

I'm passionate about crafting robust, scalable solutions, I thrive on transforming intricate challenges into elegant solutions.In a world of 1s and 0s, I believe in the elegance of simplicity and the power of clean, maintainable code. 
Whether it's optimizing algorithms or sculpting databases, I strive for efficiency without compromising clarity.

🚀 Currently, I'm an experienced freelance Golang engineer, crafting custom solutions that drive business success. My projects range from building bespoke CRM systems tailored to clients' unique needs to developing sophisticated analytical software for decision-making.

💼 Seeking a full-time permanent role to bring my expertise in Go development to a dynamic team and contribute to impactful projects on a larger scale.

🛠️ Tech I Love: Leveraging concurrency in Go, harnessing goroutines, working with Gorilla Mux for routing, diving into databases with MySQL and PostgreSQL, crafting command-line interfaces with Cobra, and wielding tools like bufio and strconv for efficient data processing

👽 Outside of programming, I'm a huge fan of classic sci-fi, especially the Star Trek and Stargate franchises. I'm also an avid gamer and enjoy playing playing both retro and modern video games. Retro favourites include Sega Mega Drive titles like the Sonic series and Streets of Rage, as well as shooters like Doom and Quake. Modern favourites include the Halo and Mass Effect franchises.

🔗 My GitHub serves as a curated showcase of projects, from professional-level examples to smaller projects highlighting specific skills and the versatility of Golang.
